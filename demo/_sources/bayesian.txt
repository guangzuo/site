**Review of Bayesian Analysis**
===============================

This section is to review the Bayesian Analysis. And the materials are taken from the course E724 "Time Series" taught by Prof. Joon Park.

Markov Chain Monte Carlo
------------------------

- For complicated density, we can construct Markov process whose time invariant distribution is same as the original density.
- We often call the "given density" as the "target density".
- Remark

  - We can use :math:`F(x) \sim U[0,1]`, and MCMC only serves as a last resort.  
  - Second option is to construct Markov process since drawing i.i.d. sample is impossible. 

- Important Lemmas

  - **Lemma1:** If transition :math:`P_1, P_2` have invariant distribution :math:`\pi`, then so does :math:`P=P_1 \cdot P_2`. They have the same invariant distribution.
  - **Lemma2:** If a chain has a proper invariant distribution and it is irreducible and aperiodic, then :math:`\pi` is the unique invariant distribution and is also the equilibrium distribution of the chain.
  - **Periodicity:** If the chain visits some value (for any subset of the state space) periodically.
  - **Irreducibility:** No matter where you are, you can visit with positive probability any place in the state space next time.

- Two important Markov Chains:
  
  - Gibbs Sampler
  - Metropolis-Hastings' Algorithm
