Procedures
++++++++++

- This file has a list of all variables used :download:`vars.do<data_analysis/combined/vars.do>` (do need to run it). 
- Prepare the data using the do file here :download:`predata.do<data_analysis/combined/prepdata.do>`. This is to generate **psid_combined.dta** data file.
- Some exploratory data analysis can be found here :download:`test_person.do<data_analysis/combined/test_person.do>`

  - Try x11101ll == 18004

    white male 20yrs since 1971  educ = 12 years worked in manufacturing till 1981, he then became construction worker since 1981, and income has declined dramatically (definitely an example of permanent shock).

  - Try x11101ll == 18005

    white male 19yrs since 1971  educ = 12 years worked in manufacturing his life time till 1999 (46yrs), he then was laid off and engaged in agriculture activity. This guy is so stubborn to hold on to manufacturing, a dying industry.


  - Try x11101ll == 459001

    white male 37yrs since 1971  educ = 12 years. He did really take the hit of inforrmational revoluation, so if you look at his income profile, it shows to be very stable and definitely less uncertainty. As you can see from his annual wage profile below

  - Try x11101ll == 122004

    white male 18yrs since 1985  educ = 12 years. He experienced the post-informational era where the world is more uncertain.

  - Try x11101ll == 284001

    white male 39yrs since 1971  educ = 16 years. He started his life in professional service and really enjoy a decent life and retire when he was 60yrs in 1992.

  - Try x11101ll == 997003

    white male 35yrs since 1977  educ = 12 years. He experienced the post-informational era where the world is more uncertain. And the shock since 1980 seems to be permanant.

  - Try x11101ll == 913005

    white male 22yrs since 1981  educ = 16 years. His education ensures him a stable income path even in the transitional economy.

  - Try x11101ll == 1072003

    white male 22yrs since 1984  educ = 12 years. Apparently, high school education is not enough to lead to a better life in this informational era. He worked in manufacturing till 2007 when he was 45 yrs old, and finally switched to whole sale and retail trade sector in 2009 when he was 47 yrs old.

  - Try x11101ll == 1075001

    white male 38yrs since 1971 educ = 12 years. Apparently, he has a very different life from the person above although with the same level of educational attainment. He worked in manufacturing sector till he retired in 1991 when he was 58 yrs old.

- Generate **LogWageResidBayesian.dta** used in the Bayesian analysis by running this do file :download:`prepdata_bayeisan.do<data_analysis/combined/prepdata_bayeisan.do>`.






Use **STATA** to Analyze
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Techniques in STATA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- When using **psiduse.do**, one needs to specify the option regarding the design. Since the default is the balanced design, and this is the reason why I kept getting fewer observations than other people. (700+ VS 3000+)

- The command xi_ can really ease the creation of indicator variables, and make it easier to include interactions in your models by allowing you to include interaction terms such as i.prog*female. The xi command also gives you the flexibility to decide which category would be the omitted category (unlike the anova command). 

.. _xi: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/webbooks/reg/chapter3/statareg3.htm


- The reshape_ command can convert the data from wide format into long format. This is a very handy command. 

.. _reshape: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/modules/reshapel.htm


- **recode** into categorical variables and **rename** the variable::

    generate agegrp = age
    recode agegrp (30/39=1) (40/49=2) (50/59=3)
    label define educ_lbl 1 "Elementary School" 2 "Some Hish School" 3 "High School Graduate" 4 "Some College"  ///
                          5 "College Graduate" 6 "Graduate School"
    label value educgrp educ_lbl

- **Stata Arithmetic/String Operators**, **Relational Operators** and **Logical Operators** can be found here :download:`operator.pdf<doc/operator.pdf>`

- **collapse** data in STATA::

    collapse (p10) p10wage = log_real_wagehead (median) medwage =  log_real_wagehead (p90) p90wage = log_real_wagehead ///
                             (p99) p99wage = log_real_wagehead (sd) sdwage = log_real_wagehead [aw=indwgt], by(year)
    gen p10wage_norm = p10wage/p10wage[1]
    gen medwage_norm = medwage/medwage[1]
    gen p90wage_norm = p90wage/p90wage[1]
    gen p99wage_norm = p99wage/p99wage[1]

    graph twoway (connected p10wage_norm year) (connected medwage_norm year) (connected p90wage_norm year) ///
                 (connected p99wage_norm year) ,title("Different Percentiles of Log Wage Head")

    graph twoway connected sdwage year,title("Standard Deviation of Log Wage Head")		 

- **levelsof** can help to cycle through each value in some specific variables when the values are not consecutive::

    ** regress log_real_wagehead against age + age3 + educational dummies
    gen residual = . // generate a place to hold residuals

    levelsof year, local(lvls)
    foreach l of local lvls {
        regress log_real_wagehead age age3 i.educgrp if year == `l' [pw=indwgt]
	predict res_`l' if year == `l', residual
	replace residual = res_`l' if year == `l'
	drop res_`l'
    }
